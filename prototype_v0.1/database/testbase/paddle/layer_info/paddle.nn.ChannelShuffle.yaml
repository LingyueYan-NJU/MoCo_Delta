    descp: The data format of the input and output data. An optional string of NCHW
      or NHWC. The default is NCHW. When it is NCHW, the data is stored in the order
      of [batch_size, input_channels, input_height, input_width]

descp: 'Can divide channels in a tensor of shape [N, C, H, W] or [N, H, W, C] into
  g groups, getting a tensor with the shape of [N, g, C/g, H, W] or [N, H, W, g, C/g],
  and transposes them as [N, C/g, g, H, W] or [N, H, W, g, C/g], then rearranges them
  to original tensor shape. This operation can improve the interaction between channels,
  using features efficiently. Please refer to the paper: ShuffleNet: An Extremely
  Efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Mobile Devices . by Zhang et. al (2017)
  for more details.'
