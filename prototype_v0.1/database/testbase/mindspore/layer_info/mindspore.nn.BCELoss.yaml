api: mindspore.nn.BCELoss(weight=None, reduction='mean')
descp: BCELoss creates a criterion to measure the binary cross entropy between the
  true labels and predicted labels.
constraints:
  weight:
    descp: 'weight (Tensor, optional) – A rescaling weight applied to the loss of each batch element. And it must have the same shape and data type as inputs. Default: None .'
    default: None
    dtype:
    - tensor
  reduction:
    descp: 'reduction (str) – Specifies the reduction to be applied to the output. Its value must be one of ''none'' , ''mean'' , ''sum'' . Default: ''mean'' .'
    default: mean
    dtype:
    - str
    enum:
    - none
    - mean
    - sum
inputs:
  optional:
  - weight
  - reduction
  required: []
