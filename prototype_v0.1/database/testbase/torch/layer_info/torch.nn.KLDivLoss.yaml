api: torch.nn.KLDivLoss(class , size_average=None, reduce=None, reduction='mean',
  log_target=False)
constraints:
  size_average:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged over each
      loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there are multiple elements
      per sample. If the field size_average is set to False, the losses are instead
      summed for each minibatch. Ignored when reduce is False.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduce:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged or summed
      over observations for each minibatch depending on size_average. When reduce
      is False, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores size_average.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduction:
    descp: Specifies the reduction to apply to the output.
    default: "\u201Cmean\u201D"
    dtype:
    - str
    enum: null
  log_target:
    descp: Specifies whether target is the log space.
    default: 'False'
    dtype:
    - bool
descp: The Kullback-Leibler divergence loss.
