api: torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d(num_features, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=False,
  track_running_stats=False, device=None, dtype=None)
constraints:
  affine:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module has learnable affine
      parameters, initialized the same way as done for batch normalization.
    default: false
    dtype: torch.bool
  eps:
    descp: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
    default: 1e-05
    dtype: torch.float
  momentum:
    descp: the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation.
    default: 0.1
    dtype: torch.float
  num_features:
    descp: number of features or channels
    dtype: int
    structure:
    - integer
    shape: 1
    range:
    - 1
    - 200
  track_running_stats:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module tracks the running mean
      and variance, and when set to False, this module does not track such statistics
      and always uses batch statistics in both training and eval modes.
    default: false
    dtype: torch.bool
descp: 'Applies Instance Normalization over a 2D (unbatched) or 3D (batched) input
  as described in the paper Instance Normalization: The Missing Ingredient for Fast
  Stylization.'
inputs:
  optional:
