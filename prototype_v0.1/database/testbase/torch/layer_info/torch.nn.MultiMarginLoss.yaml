constraints:
  p:
    descp: Has a default value of 111. 111 and 222 are the only supported values.
    dtype:
    - int
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
    range: null
  margin:
    descp: Has a default value of 111.
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  weight:
    descp: a manual rescaling weight given to each class. If given, it has to be a
      Tensor of size C. Otherwise, it is treated as if having all ones.
    dtype:
    - tensor, optional
  size_average:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged over each
      loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there are multiple elements
      per sample. If the field size_average is set to False, the losses are instead
      summed for each minibatch. Ignored when reduce is False.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduce:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged or summed
      over observations for each minibatch depending on size_average. When reduce
      is False, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores size_average.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduction:
    descp: 'Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: none | mean | sum. none:
      no reduction will be applied, mean: the sum of the output will be divided by
      the number of elements in the output, sum: the output will be summed. Note:
      size_average and reduce are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
      specifying either of those two args will override reduction.'
    default: mean
