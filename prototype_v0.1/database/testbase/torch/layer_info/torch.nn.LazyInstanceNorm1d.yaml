constraints:
  num_features:
    descp: CCC from an expected input of size (N,C,L)(N, C, L)(N,C,L) or (C,L)(C,
      L)(C,L)
  eps:
    descp: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
    default: 1e-5
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  momentum:
    descp: the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation.
    default: '0.1'
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  affine:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module has learnable affine
      parameters, initialized the same way as done for batch normalization.
    default: False.
    dtype:
    - bool
  track_running_stats:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module tracks the running mean
      and variance, and when set to False, this module does not track such statistics
      and always uses batch statistics in both training and eval modes.
    default: 'False'
    dtype:
    - bool
descp: A torch.nn.InstanceNorm1d module with lazy initialization of the num_features
  argument of the InstanceNorm1d that is inferred from the input.size(1). The attributes
  that will be lazily initialized are weight, bias, running_mean and running_var.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - num_features
  - eps
  - momentum
  - affine
  - track_running_stats
