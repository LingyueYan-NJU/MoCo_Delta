api: mindspore.nn.ChannelShuffle(groups)
constraints:
  groups:
    default: null
    descp: "groups (int) \u2013 Number of groups to divide channels in, must be greater\
      \ than 0. Refer to (g)."
    dtype:
    - int
    range: null
    structure:
    - single
descp: Divide the channels of Tensor whose shape is \((*, C, H, W)\) into \(g\) groups
  to obtain a Tensor with shape \((*, C \frac g, g, H, W)\), and transpose along the
  corresponding axis of \(C\), \(\frac{g}{}\) and \(g\) to restore Tensor to the original
  shape.
inputs:
  optional: []

  - groups
