api: mindspore.nn.ChannelShuffle(groups)
descp: Divide the channels of Tensor whose shape is \((*, C, H, W)\) into \(g\) groups
  to obtain a Tensor with shape \((*, C \frac g, g, H, W)\), and transpose along the
  corresponding axis of \(C\), \(\frac{g}{}\) and \(g\) to restore Tensor to the original
  shape.
constraints:
  groups:
    descp: groups (int) â€“ Number of groups to divide channels in, must be greater
      than 0. Refer to (g).
