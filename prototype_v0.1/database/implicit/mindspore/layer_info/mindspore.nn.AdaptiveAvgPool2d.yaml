api: mindspore.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size)
descp: This operator applies a 2D adaptive average pooling to an input signal composed
  of multiple input planes.
constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: output_size (Union[int, tuple]) â€“ The target output size is H x W. output_size
      can be a tuple consisted of int type H and W, or a single H for H x H, or None.
      If it is None, it means the output size is the same as the input size.
