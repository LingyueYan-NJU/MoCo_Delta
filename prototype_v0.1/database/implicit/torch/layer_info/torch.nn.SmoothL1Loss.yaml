api: torch.nn.SmoothL1Loss(class , size_average=None, reduce=None, reduction='mean',
  beta=1.0)
constraints:
  size_average:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged over each
      loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there are multiple elements
      per sample. If the field size_average is set to False, the losses are instead
      summed for each minibatch. Ignored when reduce is False.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduce:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged or summed
      over observations for each minibatch depending on size_average. When reduce
      is False, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores size_average.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduction:
    descp: 'Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: none | mean | sum. none:
      no reduction will be applied, mean: the sum of the output will be divided by
      the number of elements in the output, sum: the output will be summed. Note:
      size_average and reduce are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
      specifying either of those two args will override reduction.'
    default: mean
    dtype:
    - str
    enum: null
  beta:
    descp: Specifies the threshold at which to change between L1 and L2 loss. The
      value must be non-negative.
    default: '1.0'
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
descp: Creates a criterion that uses a squared term if the absolute element-wise error
  falls below beta and an L1 term otherwise. It is less sensitive to outliers than
  torch.nn.MSELoss and in some cases prevents exploding gradients (e.g. see the paper
  Fast R-CNN by Ross Girshick).
