constraints:
  name:
    default: None
    descp: For detailed information, please refer to Name. Usually name is no need
      to set and None by default.           Returns          A callable object of

  output_size:

    descp: The pool kernel size. If pool kernel size is a tuple or list, it must contain
      one int

    range: null
    shape: 1
    structure:
    - int
    - list
    - tuple
  return_mask:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, the index of max pooling point will be returned along with outputs.
      It cannot be set in average pooling type. Default False

    shape: null
    structure:
    - bool
descp: This operation applies a 1D adaptive max pooling over an input signal composed
  of several input planes, based on the input, output_size, return_mask parameters.
  Input(X) and output(Out) are in NCL format, where N is batch size, C is the number
  of channels, L is the length of the feature. The output tensor shape will be [N,
  C, output_size].
inputs:
  optional:
  - return_mask
  - name
  required:
  - output_size
