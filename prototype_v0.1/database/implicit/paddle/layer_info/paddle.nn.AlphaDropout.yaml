descp: Alpha Dropout is a type of Dropout that maintains the self-normalizing property.
  For an input with zero mean and unit standard deviation, the output of Alpha Dropout
  maintains the original mean and standard deviation of the input. Alpha Dropout fits
  well to SELU activate function by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation
  value.
