constraints:
  kernel_sizes:
    default: null
    descp: The size of convolution kernel, should be [k_h, k_w] or an integer k treated
      as [k, k]
    dtype:
    - int
    enum: null

  name:
    default: None
    descp: The default value is None. Normally there is no need for user to set this
      property. For more information, please refer to Name           Returns          The
      tensor formed by combining a group of sliding local blocks The output shape
      is [N, Cout, H, W] as decriabled above

  paddings:
    default: '0'
    descp: The paddings of each dimension, should be [padding_top, padding_left, padding_bottom,
      padding_right] or [padding_h, padding_w] or an integer padding. If [padding_h,
      padding_w] was given, it will expanded to [padding_h, padding_w, padding_h,
      padding_w]. If an integer padding was given, [padding, padding, padding, padding]
      will be used. For default, paddings will be [0, 0, 0, 0]

descp: Combines an array of sliding local blocks into a large containing tensor. also
  known as col2im when operated on batched 2D image tensor. Fold calculates each combined
  value in the resulting large tensor by summing all values from all containing blocks.
