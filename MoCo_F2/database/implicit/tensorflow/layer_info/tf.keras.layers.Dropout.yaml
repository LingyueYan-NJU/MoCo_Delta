api: tf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate, noise_shape=None, seed=None, **kwargs)
constraints:
  noise_shape:
    default: None
    descp: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the binary dropout mask that
      will be multiplied with the input. For instance, if your inputs have shape (batch_size,
      timesteps, features) and you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps,
      you can use noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features).
  rate:
    default: 0.0
    descp: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
    dtype: float
descp: Applies Dropout to the input.
required:
- rate
