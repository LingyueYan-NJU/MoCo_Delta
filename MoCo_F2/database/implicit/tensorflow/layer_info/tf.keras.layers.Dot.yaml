api: tf.keras.layers.Dot(axes, normalize=False, **kwargs)
constraints:
  axes:
    default: (0, 0)
    descp: Integer or tuple of integers, axis or axes along which to take the dot
      product. If a tuple, should be two integers corresponding to the desired axis
      from the first input and the desired axis from the second input, respectively.
      Note that the size of the two selected axes must match.
    dtype: int
    shape: 2
    structure:
    - integer
    - tuple
  normalize:
    default: false
    descp: Whether to L2-normalize samples along the dot product axis before taking
      the dot product. If set to True, then the output of the dot product is the cosine
      proximity between the two samples.
    dtype: tf.bool
descp: Layer that computes a dot product between samples in two tensors.
required:
- axes
