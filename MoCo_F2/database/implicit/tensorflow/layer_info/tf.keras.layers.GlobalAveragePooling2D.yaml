api: tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(data_format=None, keepdims=False, **kwargs)
constraints:
  data_format:
    default: None
    descp: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering
      of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape
      (batch, height, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to inputs
      with shape (batch, channels, height, width). It defaults to the image_data_format
      value found in your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json. If you never set
      it, then it will be "channels_last".
    dtype: tf.string
    enum:
    - channels_first
    - channels_last
  keepdims:
    default: false
    descp: A boolean, whether to keep the spatial dimensions or not. If keepdims is
      False (default), the rank of the tensor is reduced for spatial dimensions. If
      keepdims is True, the spatial dimensions are retained with length 1. The behavior
      is the same as for tf.reduce_mean or np.mean.
    dtype: tf.bool
descp: Global average pooling operation for spatial data.
inputs:
  required: []
  optional:
  - data_format
  - keepdims
