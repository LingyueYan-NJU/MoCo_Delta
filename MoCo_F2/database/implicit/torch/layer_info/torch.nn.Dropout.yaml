api: torch.nn.Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)
constraints:
  inplace:
    descp: If set to True, will do this operation in-place.
    default: false
    dtype: torch.bool
  p:
    descp: probability of an element to be zeroed.
    default: 0.5
    dtype: float
descp: During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with
  probability p using samples from a Bernoulli distribution. Each channel will be
  zeroed out independently on every forward call.
inputs:
  optional:
  - p
  - inplace
  required: []
