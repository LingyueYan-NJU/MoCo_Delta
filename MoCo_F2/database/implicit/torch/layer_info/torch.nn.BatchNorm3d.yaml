constraints:
  affine:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module has learnable affine
      parameters.
    default: true
    dtype: torch.bool
  eps:
    descp: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
    default: 1e-05
    dtype: float
  momentum:
    descp: the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation. Can be
      set to None for cumulative moving average (i.e. simple average).
    default: 0.1
    dtype: float
  num_features:
    descp: ''
    dtype: int
    structure:
    - integer
    - tuple
    shape: 2
    range:
    - 1
    - 12544
  track_running_stats:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module tracks the running mean
      and variance, and when set to False, this module does not track such statistics,
      and initializes statistics buffers None. When these buffers are None, this module
      always uses batch statistics. in both training and eval modes.
    default: true

  Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift .'
