descp: Implements the Adagrad algorithm. Adagrad is an online Learning and Stochastic Optimization.
constraints:
  params:
    descp: 'params (Union[list[Parameter], list[dict]]) – Must be list of Parameter
      or list of dict. When the params is a list of dict, the string “params”, “lr”,
      “weight_decay”, “grad_centralization” and “order_params” are the keys can be
      parsed.  params: Required. Parameters in current group. The value must be a
      list of Parameter. lr: Optional. If “lr” in the keys, the value of corresponding
      learning rate will be used. If not, the learning_rate in optimizer will be used.
      Fixed and dynamic learning rate are supported. weight_decay: Optional. If “weight_decay”
      in the keys, the value of corresponding weight decay will be used. If not, the
      weight_decay in the optimizer will be used. It should be noted that weight decay
      can be a constant value or a Cell. It is a Cell only when dynamic weight decay
      is applied. Dynamic weight decay is similar to dynamic learning rate, users
      need to customize a weight decay schedule only with global step as input, and
      during training, the optimizer calls the instance of WeightDecaySchedule to
      get the weight decay value of current step. grad_centralization: Optional. Must
      be Boolean. If “grad_centralization” is in the keys, the set value will be used.
      If not, the grad_centralization is False by default. This configuration only
      works on the convolution layer. order_params: Optional. When parameters is grouped,
      this usually is used to maintain the order of parameters that appeared in the
      network to improve performance. The value should be parameters whose order will
      be followed in optimizer. If order_params in the keys, other keys will be ignored
      and the element of ‘order_params’ must be in one group of params.  '

      or a 1-D vector. For scalar, fixed learning rate will be applied. For vector,
      learning rate is dynamic, then the i-th step will take the i-th value as the
      learning rate. Iterable: Learning rate is dynamic. The i-th step will take the
      i-th value as the learning rate. LearningRateSchedule: Learning rate is dynamic.

      step as the input to get the learning rate of current step.  '
