api: mindspore.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d(output_size)
descp: This operator applies a 3D adaptive average pooling to an input signal composed
  of multiple input planes.
constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: output_size (Union[int, tuple]) â€“ The target output size. output_size can
      be a tuple ((D, H, W)), or an int D for ((D, D, D)). (D), (H) and (W) can be
      int or None which means the output size is the same as that of the input.
