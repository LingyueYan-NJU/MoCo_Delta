descp: During training, randomly zeroes entire channels of the input tensor with probability
  p from a Bernoulli distribution (For a 3-dimensional tensor with a shape of \((N,
  C, L)\), the channel feature map refers to a 1-dimensional feature map with the
  shape of \(L\)).
constraints:
  p:
    descp: 'p (float, optional) â€“ The dropping probability of a channel, between 0 and 1, e.g. p = 0.8, which means an 80% chance of being set to 0. Default: 0.5 .'
    default: 0.5
