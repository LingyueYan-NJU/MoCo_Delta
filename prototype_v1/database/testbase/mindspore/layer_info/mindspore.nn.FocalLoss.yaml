api: mindspore.nn.FocalLoss(weight=None, gamma=2.0, reduction='mean')
descp: It is a loss function to solve the imbalance of categories and the difference
  of classification difficulty.

      in focal loss. Default: 2.0 .'

  weight:
    descp: 'weight (Union[Tensor, None]) – A rescaling weight applied to the loss
      of each batch element. The dimension of weight should be 1. If None, no weight
      is applied. Default: None .'
