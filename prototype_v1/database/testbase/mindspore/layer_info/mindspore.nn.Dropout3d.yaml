api: mindspore.nn.Dropout3d(p=0.5)
descp: During training, randomly zeroes some channels of the input tensor with probability p from a Bernoulli distribution (For a 5-dimensional tensor with a shape of NCDHW, the channel feature map refers to a 3-dimensional feature map with a shape of DHW).
constraints:
  p:
    descp: 'p (float) â€“ The dropping probability of a channel, between 0 and 1, e.g. p = 0.8, which means dropping out 80% of channels. Default: 0.5 .'
    default: 0.5
    dtype:
    - float
inputs:
  optional:
  - p
  required: []
