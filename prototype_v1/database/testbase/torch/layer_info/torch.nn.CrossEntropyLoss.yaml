api: torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(class , weight=None, size_average=None, ignore_index=-
  100, reduce=None, reduction='mean', label_smoothing=0.0)
constraints:
  weight:
    descp: a manual rescaling weight given to each class. If given, has to be a Tensor
      of size C
    dtype:
    - tensor, optional
  size_average:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged over each
      loss element in the batch. Note that for some losses, there are multiple elements
      per sample. If the field size_average is set to False, the losses are instead
      summed for each minibatch. Ignored when reduce is False.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  ignore_index:
    descp: Specifies a target value that is ignored and does not contribute to the
      input gradient. When size_average is True, the loss is averaged over non-ignored
      targets. Note that ignore_index is only applicable when the target contains
      class indices.
    dtype:
    - int
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
    range: null
  reduce:
    descp: Deprecated (see reduction). By default, the losses are averaged or summed
      over observations for each minibatch depending on size_average. When reduce
      is False, returns a loss per batch element instead and ignores size_average.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  reduction:
    descp: 'Specifies the reduction to apply to the output: none | mean | sum. none:
      no reduction will be applied, mean: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
      sum: the output will be summed. Note: size_average and reduce are in the process
      of being deprecated, and in the meantime, specifying either of those two args
      will override reduction.'
    default: mean
    dtype:
    - str
    enum: null
  label_smoothing:
    descp: A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount of smoothing when computing
      the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets become a mixture of the
      original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in Rethinking
      the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision.
    default: 0.00.00.0.
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
descp: This criterion computes the cross entropy loss between input logits and target.
