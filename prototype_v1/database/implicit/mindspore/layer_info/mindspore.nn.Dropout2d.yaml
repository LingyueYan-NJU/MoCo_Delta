constraints:
  p:
    default: 0.5
    descp: "p (float) \u2013 The dropping probability of a channel, between 0 and\
      \ 1, e.g. p = 0.8, which means dropping out 80% of channels. Default: 0.5 ."
    dtype:
    - float
descp: During training, randomly zeroes some channels of the input tensor with probability
  p from a Bernoulli distribution (For a 4-dimensional tensor with a shape of NCHW,
  the channel feature map refers to a 2-dimensional feature map with the shape of
  HW).
inputs:
  optional:
  - p
  required: []
