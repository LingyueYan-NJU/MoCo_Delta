api: torch.nn.Dropout1d(class , p=0.5, inplace=False)
constraints:
  p:
    descp: probability of an element to be zero-ed.
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  inplace:
    descp: If set to True, will do this operation in-place
    dtype:
    - bool
descp: Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 1D feature map, e.g., the
  jjj-th channel of the iii-th sample in the batched input is a 1D tensor input[i,j]\text{input}[i,
  j]input[i,j]). Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call
  with probability p using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

  optional:
  - p
  - inplace
  required: []
