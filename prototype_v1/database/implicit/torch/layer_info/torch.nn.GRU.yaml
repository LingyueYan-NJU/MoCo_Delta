api: torch.nn.GRU(class , *args, **kwargs)
constraints:
  input_size:
    descp: The number of expected features in the input x
  hidden_size:
    descp: The number of features in the hidden state h
  num_layers:
    descp: Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting num_layers=2 would mean stacking
      two GRUs together to form a stacked GRU, with the second GRU taking in outputs
      of the first GRU and computing the final results.
    default: '1'
  bias:
    descp: If False, then the layer does not use bias weights b_ih and b_hh.
    default: 'True'
  batch_first:
    descp: If True, then the input and output tensors are provided as (batch, seq,
      feature) instead of (seq, batch, feature). Note that this does not apply to
      hidden or cell states. See the Inputs/Outputs sections below for details.
    default: 'False'
  dropout:
    descp: If non-zero, introduces a Dropout layer on the outputs of each GRU layer
      except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to dropout.
    default: '0'
  bidirectional:
    descp: If True, becomes a bidirectional GRU.
    default: 'False'
descp: Applies a multi-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) RNN to an input sequence.
