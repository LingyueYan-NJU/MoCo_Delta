api: torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool3d(class , output_size)
constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the form D x H x W. Can be a tuple (D, H, W)
      or a single number D for a cube D x D x D. D, H and W can be either a int, or
      None which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    structure:
    - single
    - tuple
    shape: null
    range: null
    enum:
    - none
descp: Applies a 3D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several
  input planes.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - output_size
