  device=None, dtype=None)
constraints:
  eps:
    descp: a value added to the denominator for numerical stability.
    default: 1e-5
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  momentum:
    descp: the value used for the running_mean and running_var computation. Can be
      set to None for cumulative moving average (i.e. simple average).
    default: '0.1'
    dtype:
    - float
    structure:
    - single
    shape: null
  affine:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module has learnable affine
      parameters.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
  track_running_stats:
    descp: a boolean value that when set to True, this module tracks the running mean
      and variance, and when set to False, this module does not track such statistics,
      and initializes statistics buffers running_mean and running_var as None. When
      these buffers are None, this module always uses batch statistics. in both training
      and eval modes.
    default: 'True'
    dtype:
    - bool
descp: A torch.nn.BatchNorm1d module with lazy initialization of the num_features
  argument of the BatchNorm1d that is inferred from the input.size(1). The attributes
  that will be lazily initialized are weight, bias, running_mean and running_var.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - eps
  - momentum
  - affine
  - track_running_stats
