api: tf.keras.layers.Permute(dims, **kwargs)
constraints:
  dims:
    descp: Tuple of integers. Permutation pattern, does not include the samples dimension.
      Indexing starts at 1. For instance, `(2, 1)` permutes the first and second dimensions
      of the input.
    dtype:
    - int
    - tf.string
    structure:
    - tuple
descp: Permutes the dimensions of the input according to a given pattern.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - dims
