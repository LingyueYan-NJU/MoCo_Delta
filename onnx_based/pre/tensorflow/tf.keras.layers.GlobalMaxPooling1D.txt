tf.keras.layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D
data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, steps, features) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, features, steps).
keepdims: A boolean, whether to keep the temporal dimension or not. If keepdims is False (default), the rank of the tensor is reduced for spatial dimensions. If keepdims is True, the temporal dimension are retained with length 1. The behavior is the same as for tf.reduce_max or np.max.
