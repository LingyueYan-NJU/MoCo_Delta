tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D
pool_size: integer or tuple of 2 integers, window size over which to take the maximum. (2, 2) will take the max value over a 2x2 pooling window. If only one integer is specified, the same window length will be used for both dimensions.
strides: Integer, tuple of 2 integers, or None. Strides values. Specifies how far the pooling window moves for each pooling step. If None, it will default to pool_size.
padding: One of "valid" or "same" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding. "same" results in padding evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input.
data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, height, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, channels, height, width). When unspecified, uses image_data_format value found in your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json (if exists) else 'channels_last'. Defaults to 'channels_last'.
