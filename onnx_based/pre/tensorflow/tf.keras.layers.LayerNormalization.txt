tf.keras.layers.LayerNormalization
axis: Integer or List/Tuple. The axis or axes to normalize across. Typically, this is the features axis/axes. The left-out axes are typically the batch axis/axes. -1 is the last dimension in the input. Defaults to -1.
epsilon: Small float added to variance to avoid dividing by zero. Defaults to 1e-3
center: If True, add offset of beta to normalized tensor. If False, beta is ignored. Defaults to True.
scale: If True, multiply by gamma. If False, gamma is not used. When the next layer is linear (also e.g. nn.relu), this can be disabled since the scaling will be done by the next layer. Defaults to True.
beta_initializer: Initializer for the beta weight. Defaults to zeros.
gamma_initializer: Initializer for the gamma weight. Defaults to ones.
beta_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the beta weight. None by default.
gamma_regularizer: Optional regularizer for the gamma weight. None by default.
beta_constraint: Optional constraint for the beta weight. None by default.
gamma_constraint: Optional constraint for the gamma weight. None by default.
