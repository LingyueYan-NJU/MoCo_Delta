tf.keras.layers.Conv1D
filters: Integer, the dimensionality of the output space (i.e. the number of output filters in the convolution).
kernel_size: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the length of the 1D convolution window.
strides: An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the stride length of the convolution. Specifying any stride value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any dilation_rate value != 1.
padding: One of "valid", "same" or "causal" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding. "same" results in padding with zeros evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input. "causal" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. output[t] does not depend on input[t+1:]. Useful when modeling temporal data where the model should not violate the temporal order. See WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio, section  2.1.
data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch_size, width, channels) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch_size, channels, width). Note that the channels_first format is currently not supported by TensorFlow on CPU.
dilation_rate: an integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the dilation rate to use for dilated convolution. Currently, specifying any dilation_rate value != 1 is incompatible with specifying any strides value != 1.
groups: A positive integer specifying the number of groups in which the input is split along the channel axis. Each group is convolved separately with filters / groups filters. The output is the concatenation of all the groups results along the channel axis. Input channels and filters must both be divisible by groups.
activation: Activation function to use. If you don't specify anything, no activation is applied (see keras.activations).
use_bias: Boolean, whether the layer uses a bias vector.
kernel_initializer: Initializer for the kernel weights matrix (see keras.initializers). Defaults to 'glorot_uniform'.
bias_initializer: Initializer for the bias vector (see keras.initializers). Defaults to 'zeros'.
kernel_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the kernel weights matrix (see keras.regularizers).
bias_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the bias vector (see keras.regularizers).
activity_regularizer: Regularizer function applied to the output of the layer (its "activation") (see keras.regularizers).
kernel_constraint: Constraint function applied to the kernel matrix (see keras.constraints).
bias_constraint: Constraint function applied to the bias vector (see keras.constraints).
