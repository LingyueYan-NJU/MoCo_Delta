tf.keras.layers.AveragePooling1D
pool_size: Integer, size of the average pooling windows.
strides: Integer, or None. Factor by which to downscale. E.g. 2 will halve the input. If None, it will default to pool_size.
padding: One of "valid" or "same" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding. "same" results in padding evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input.
data_format: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, steps, features) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, features, steps).
