tf.keras.layers.Dropout
rate: Float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the input units to drop.
noise_shape: 1D integer tensor representing the shape of the binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input. For instance, if your inputs have shape (batch_size, timesteps, features) and you want the dropout mask to be the same for all timesteps, you can use noise_shape=(batch_size, 1, features).
seed: A Python integer to use as random seed.
