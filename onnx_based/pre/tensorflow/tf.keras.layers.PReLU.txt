tf.keras.layers.PReLU
alpha_initializer: Initializer function for the weights.
alpha_regularizer: Regularizer for the weights.
alpha_constraint: Constraint for the weights.
shared_axes: The axes along which to share learnable parameters for the activation function. For example, if the incoming feature maps are from a 2D convolution with output shape (batch, height, width, channels), and you wish to share parameters across space so that each filter only has one set of parameters, set shared_axes=[1, 2].
