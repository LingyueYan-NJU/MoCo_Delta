type: T1. Input data tensor that has to be unpooled. This tensor is typicallythe first output of the MaxPool op.Dimensions for image case are (Nx C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number ofchannels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data. Fornon-image case, the dimensions are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2… Dn), where N is the batch size. Optionally, if dimensiondenotation is in effect, the operation expects the input data tensorto arrive with the dimension denotation of [DATA_BATCH,DATA_CHANNEL, DATA_FEATURE, DATA_FEATURE …].
