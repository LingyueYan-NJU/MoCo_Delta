type: T2. Input data tensor containing the indices corresponding to elementsin the first input tensor X.This tensor is typically the secondoutput of the MaxPool op.Dimensions must be the same as input tensorX. The indices are linear, i.e. computed considering the tensor asflattened 1-D tensor, assuming row-major storage. Also, the linearindices should not consider padding. So the values in indices are inthe range [0, N x C x D1 x â€¦ x Dn).
