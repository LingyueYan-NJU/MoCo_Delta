type: INTS. Additional elements added to the side with higher coordinate indices
in the output. Each padding value in “output_padding” must be less
than the corresponding stride/dilation dimension. By default, this
attribute is a zero vector. Note that this attribute doesn’t
directly affect the computed output values. It only controls the
selection of the computed values, so changing this attribute only
adds or removes output elements. If “output_shape” is explicitly
provided, “output_padding” does not contribute additional size to
“output_shape” but participates in the computation of the needed
padding amount. This is also called adjs or adjustment in some
frameworks.
