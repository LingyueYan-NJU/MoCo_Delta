type: INTS. The shape of the output can be explicitly set which will cause pads
values to be auto generated. If output_shape is specified pads
values are ignored. See doc for details for equations to generate
pads. Note that the output_shape attribute value should not include
dimensions for batch size and channels, which are automatically
inferred.
