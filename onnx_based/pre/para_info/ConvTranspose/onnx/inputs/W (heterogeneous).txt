type: T. The weight tensor that will be used in the convolutions; has size (Cx M/group x kH x kW), where C is the number of channels, and kH andkW are the height and width of the kernel, and M is the number offeature maps. For more than 2 dimensions, the weight shape will be(C x M/group x k1 x k2 x … x kn), where (k1 x k2 x … x kn) isthe dimension of the kernel. The number of channels in the outputshould be equal to W.shape[1] * group (assuming zero based indicesof the shape array)
