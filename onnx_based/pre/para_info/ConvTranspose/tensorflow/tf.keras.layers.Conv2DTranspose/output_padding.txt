An integer or tuple/list of 2 integers, specifying the amount of padding along the height and width of the output tensor. Can be a single integer to specify the same value for all spatial dimensions. The amount of output padding along a given dimension must be lower than the stride along that same dimension. If set to None (default), the output shape is inferred.
