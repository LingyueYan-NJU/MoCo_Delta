type: INT. Indicate up to which input dimensions (exclusive) should be
flattened to the outer dimension of the output. The value for axis
must be in the range [-r, r], where r is the rank of the input
tensor. Negative value means counting dimensions from the back. When
axis = 0, the shape of the output tensor is (1, (d_0 X d_1 … d_n),
where the shape of the input tensor is (d_0, d_1, … d_n).
