type: INT. The shape format of inputs X, initial_h and outputs Y, Y_h. If 0,
the following shapes are expected: X.shape = [seq_length,
batch_size, input_size], Y.shape = [seq_length, num_directions,
batch_size, hidden_size], initial_h.shape = Y_h.shape =
[num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size]. If 1, the following
shapes are expected: X.shape = [batch_size, seq_length, input_size],
Y.shape = [batch_size, seq_length, num_directions, hidden_size],
initial_h.shape = Y_h.shape = [batch_size, num_directions,
hidden_size].
