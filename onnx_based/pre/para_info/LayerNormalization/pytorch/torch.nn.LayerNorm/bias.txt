type: bool. If set to False, the layer will not learn an additive bias (only relevant if elementwise_affine is True). Default: True.   Variables  weight – the learnable weights of the module of shape normalized_shape\text{normalized\_shape}normalized_shape when elementwise_affine is set to True. The values are initialized to 1. bias – the learnable bias of the module of shape normalized_shape\text{normalized\_shape}normalized_shape when elementwise_affine is set to True. The values are initialized to 0.
