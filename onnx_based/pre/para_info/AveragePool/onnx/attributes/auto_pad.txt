type: STRING. auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID.
Where default value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used.
SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER mean pad the input so that output_shape[i] = ceil(input_shape[i] / strides[i]) for each axis i. The padding
is split between the two sides equally or almost equally (depending
on whether it is even or odd). In case the padding is an odd number,
the extra padding is added at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the
beginning for SAME_LOWER.
