A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels) while channels_first corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3). When unspecified, uses image_data_format value found in your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json (if exists) else 'channels_last'. Defaults to 'channels_last'.
