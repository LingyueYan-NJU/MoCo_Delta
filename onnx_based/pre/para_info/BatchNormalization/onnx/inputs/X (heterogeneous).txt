type: T. Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions are in theform of (N x C x D1 x D2 â€¦ Dn), where N is the batch size, C isthe number of channels. Statistics are computed for every channel ofC over N and D1 to Dn dimensions. For image data, input dimensionsbecome (N x C x H x W). The op also accepts single dimension inputof size N in which case C is assumed to be 1
