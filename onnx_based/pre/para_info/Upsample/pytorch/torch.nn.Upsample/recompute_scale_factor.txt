type: bool. recompute the scale_factor for use in the interpolation calculation. If recompute_scale_factor is True, then scale_factor must be passed in and scale_factor is used to compute the output size. The computed output size will be used to infer new scales for the interpolation. Note that when scale_factor is floating-point, it may differ from the recomputed scale_factor due to rounding and precision issues. If recompute_scale_factor is False, then size or scale_factor will be used directly for interpolation.
