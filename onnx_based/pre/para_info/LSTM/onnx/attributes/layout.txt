type: INT. The shape format of inputs X, initial_h, initial_c and outputs Y,
Y_h, Y_c. If 0, the following shapes are expected: X.shape =
[seq_length, batch_size, input_size], Y.shape = [seq_length,
num_directions, batch_size, hidden_size], initial_h.shape =
Y_h.shape = initial_c.shape = Y_c.shape = [num_directions,
batch_size, hidden_size]. If 1, the following shapes are expected:
X.shape = [batch_size, seq_length, input_size], Y.shape =
[batch_size, seq_length, num_directions, hidden_size],
initial_h.shape = Y_h.shape = initial_c.shape = Y_c.shape =
[batch_size, num_directions, hidden_size].
