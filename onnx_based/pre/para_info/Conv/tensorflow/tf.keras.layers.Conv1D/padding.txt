One of "valid", "same" or "causal" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding. "same" results in padding with zeros evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input. "causal" results in causal (dilated) convolutions, e.g. output[t] does not depend on input[t+1:]. Useful when modeling temporal data where the model should not violate the temporal order. See WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio, section  2.1.
