type: T. The weight tensor that will be used in the convolutions; has size (Mx C/group x kH x kW), where C is the number of channels, and kH andkW are the height and width of the kernel, and M is the number offeature maps. For more than 2 dimensions, the kernel shape will be(M x C/group x k1 x k2 x … x kn), where (k1 x k2 x … kn) is thedimension of the kernel. Optionally, if dimension denotation is ineffect, the operation expects the weight tensor to arrive with thedimension denotation of [FILTER_OUT_CHANNEL, FILTER_IN_CHANNEL,FILTER_SPATIAL, FILTER_SPATIAL …]. Assuming zero based indices forthe shape array, X.shape[1] == (W.shape[1] * group) == C andW.shape[0] mod G == 0. Or in other words FILTER_IN_CHANNELmultiplied by the number of groups should be equal to DATA_CHANNELand the number of feature maps M should be a multiple of the numberof groups G.
