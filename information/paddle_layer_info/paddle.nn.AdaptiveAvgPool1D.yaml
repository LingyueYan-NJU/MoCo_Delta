descp: A 1D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several input
  planes, based on output_size. Input and output are in NCL format, where N is batch
  size, C is the number of channels and L is the length of the feature. The shape
  of output will be \([N, C, output\_size]\).

  optional:
  - name
  required:
  - output_size
