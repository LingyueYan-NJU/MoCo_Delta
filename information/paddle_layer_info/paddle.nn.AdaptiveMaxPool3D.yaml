constraints:

    descp: For detailed information, please refer to Name. Usually name is no need
      to set and None by default

    descp: The pool kernel size. If pool kernel size is a tuple or list, it must contain
      three elements, (D, H, W). D, H and W can be either a int, or None which means
      the size will be the same as that of the input
    dtype:
    - int
    enum: null
    range: null

    structure:
    - int
    - list
    - tuple
  return_mask:
    default: 'False'
    descp: If true, the index of max pooling point will be returned along with outputs.
      Default False

    structure:
    - bool
descp: This operation applies 3D adaptive max pooling on input tensor. The h and w
  dimensions of the output tensor are determined by the parameter output_size. The
  difference between adaptive pooling and pooling is adaptive one focus on the output
  size.
inputs:
  optional:
  - return_mask
  - name
  required:
  - output_size
