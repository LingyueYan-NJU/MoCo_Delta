  alpha_constraint:
    default: None

    default: zeros

    dtype: tf.string
  alpha_regularizer:
    default: None
    descp: Regularizer for the weights.
    dtype: tf.string
  shared_axes:
    default: None
    descp: The axes along which to share learnable parameters for the activation function.
      For example, if the incoming feature maps are from a 2D convolution with output
      shape (batch, height, width, channels), and you wish to share parameters across
      space so that each filter only has one set of parameters, set shared_axes=[1,
      2].
descp: Parametric Rectified Linear Unit.
