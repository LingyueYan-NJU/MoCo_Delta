constraints:
  dtype:
    default: None
    descp: The dtype of the layer's computations and weights. Can also be a tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy,
      which allows the computation and weight dtype to differ. Default of None means
      to use tf.keras.mixed_precision.global_policy(), which is a float32 policy unless
      set to different value.
    dtype: tf.dtype
  dynamic:
    default: false
    descp: Set this to True if your layer should only be run eagerly, and should not
      be used to generate a static computation graph. This would be the case for a
      Tree-RNN or a recursive network, for example, or generally for any layer that
      manipulates tensors using Python control flow. If False, we assume that the
      layer can safely be used to generate a static computation graph.
    dtype: tf.bool
  name:
    default: None
    descp: String name of the layer.
    dtype: tf.string
  trainable:
    default: true
    descp: Boolean, whether the layer's variables should be trainable.
    dtype: tf.bool
descp: This is the class from which all layers inherit.
required: []
