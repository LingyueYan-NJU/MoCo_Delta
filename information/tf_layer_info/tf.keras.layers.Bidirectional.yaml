constraints:
  backward_layer:
    default: None
    descp: Optional keras.layers.RNN, or keras.layers.Layer instance to be used to
      handle backwards input processing. If backward_layer is not provided, the layer
      instance passed as the layer argument will be used to generate the backward
      layer automatically. Note that the provided backward_layer layer should have
      properties matching those of the layer argument, in particular it should have
      the same values for stateful, return_states, return_sequences, etc. In addition,
      backward_layer and layer should have different go_backwards argument values.
      A ValueError will be raised if these requirements are not met.
  layer:
    default: None
    descp: 'keras.layers.RNN instance, such as keras.layers.LSTM or keras.layers.GRU.
      It could also be a keras.layers.Layer instance that meets the following criteria:'
  merge_mode:
    default: concat
    descp: Mode by which outputs of the forward and backward RNNs will be combined.
      One of {'sum', 'mul', 'concat', 'ave', None}. If None, the outputs will not
      be combined, they will be returned as a list. Default value is 'concat'.
    dtype: tf.string
    enum:
    - ave
    - concat
    - mul
    - sum
    structure: list
  weights:
    default: None
descp: Bidirectional wrapper for RNNs.
