constraints:
  data_format:
    default: None
    descp: A string, one of channels_last (default) or channels_first. The ordering
      of the dimensions in the inputs. channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape
      (batch, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2, spatial_dim3, channels) while channels_first
      corresponds to inputs with shape (batch, channels, spatial_dim1, spatial_dim2,
      spatial_dim3). It defaults to the image_data_format value found in your Keras
      config file at ~/.keras/keras.json. If you never set it, then it will be "channels_last".
    dtype: tf.string
    enum:
    - channels_first
    - channels_last
  padding:
    default: valid
    descp: One of "valid" or "same" (case-insensitive). "valid" means no padding.
      "same" results in padding evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such
      that output has the same height/width dimension as the input.
    dtype: tf.string
    enum:
    - same
    - valid
  pool_size:
    default: (2, 2, 2)
    descp: Tuple of 3 integers, factors by which to downscale (dim1, dim2, dim3).
      (2, 2, 2) will halve the size of the 3D input in each dimension.
    dtype: int
    range:
    - 0
    - 6
    shape: 3
    structure:
    - integer
    - tuple
  strides:
    default: None
    descp: tuple of 3 integers, or None. Strides values.
    dtype: int
    range:
    - 0
    - 6
    shape: 3
    structure:
    - integer
    - tuple
descp: Max pooling operation for 3D data (spatial or spatio-temporal).
required: []
