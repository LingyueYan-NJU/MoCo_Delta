api: torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(class , output_size)
constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form H x W. Can be a tuple (H,
      W) or a single H for a square image H x H. H and W can be either a int, or None
      which means the size will be the same as that of the input.
    structure:
    - single
    - tuple
    shape: null
    range: null
    enum:
    - none
descp: Applies a 2D adaptive average pooling over an input signal composed of several
  input planes.
inputs:
  optional: []
  required:
  - output_size
