constraints:
  output_size:
    descp: the target output size of the image of the form int, or None which means
      the size will be the same as that of the input.
    dtype: int
    range:
    - 1
    - 42024
    shape: 2
    structure:
    - integer
    - tuple
  return_indices:
    default: false
    descp: if True, will return the indices along with the outputs. Useful to pass
      to nn.MaxUnpool2d.
    dtype: torch.bool
descp: Applies a 2D adaptive max pooling over an input signal composed of several
  input planes.
inputs:
  optional:
  - return_indices
  required:
  - output_size
