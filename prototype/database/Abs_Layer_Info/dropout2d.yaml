api: dropout2d
constraints:
  p:
    default: 0.5
    descp: probability of an element to be zero-ed.
    dtype: torch.float
descp: Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 2D feature map, e.g., the
  jjj-th channel of the iii-th sample in the batched input is a 2D tensor input[i,j]\text{input}[i,
  j]input[i,j]). Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call
  with probability p using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.
inputs:
  optional:
  - p
  required: []
